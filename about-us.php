                                Ripple has built the next generation of transport protocols for use over the open internet — creating a state-of-the-art Worldwide Broadcasting System. Ripple has developed and patented deep learning processes to predict internet traffic congestion and leverage the adoption of WebRTC and WebSockets to build a virtual network connecting over a billion devices to efficiently stream video to an unlimited number of concurrent viewers. Ripple allows operators and broadcasters to stream linear and live video with the equivalent quality, reliability, and low latency as a fully managed network -- no blocking, stuttering, or failed video streams and is compatible with emerging 4K video. It’s easy to implement adding only a few lines of code inside the player application to provide a vastly improved viewing experience.
