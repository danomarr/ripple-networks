                                        maintaining a map of shared links interconnecting components of the underlying network (e.g., ASNs and the peering points interconnecting them);
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        generating metrics by monitoring network traffic among the nodes that cross those shared links (i.e., ASN peering points);

                                    <li>
                                         analyzing the metrics and the map over time to forecast congestion levels reflecting the changing capacity of the shared links (utilizing a deep learning engine);

                                    <li>
                                        dynamically reconfiguring the topology of the overlay networks, based on the forecasted congestion levels, to generate optimal routes for the digital content among the client nodes along the overlay networks (utilizing proprietary non-linear optimization techniques); and

                                        minimizing bandwidth utilization with a controlled overlay network utilizing WebRTC.
                                    </li>

                               Ripple handles unscheduled as well as scheduled events, streams live as well as pre-recorded events, and streams those events in real time with minimal delay in a highly scalable fashion that maintains a consistent Quality of Experience among large numbers of concurrent viewers.

                                In the context of routing packets on the Internet, distance (or geographic proximity) is not directly relevant because packets in an uncongested network travel near the speed of light.  Speed, however, is affected by:
                            </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        the number of stops or roadblocks encountered along a route, or in this context the number of “hops” encountered at intermediate routers between two nodes.  Thus, two nodes can be said to be “nearby” each other (in “network proximity”) if they are only a relatively few hops apart, regardless of their geographic proximity and
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        congestion at intermediate nodes along the path between two nodes.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                    Both these issues can be addressed by dynamically rerouting traffic – i.e., dynamically reconfiguring Ripple’s managed overlay network determining the optimal path between two nodes all the while receiving  state of the art analytics.
